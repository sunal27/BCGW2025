SkyLink Airlines: Strategic Market Entry Proposal – BCG Winter Case Competition 2025

This repository contains a strategic market entry proposal for SkyLink Airlines, created as part of the BCG Winter Case Competition 2025. The project explores international expansion opportunities for a low-cost carrier, applying structured prioritisation frameworks to shortlist markets based on demand, regulatory feasibility, and competitive pressures.

Colombia emerged as the optimal entry point, with Medellín and Cartagena selected as initial destinations due to their tourism appeal and less congested airport infrastructure compared to Bogotá. The proposal outlines a six-month pilot route from Miami, enabling SkyLink to test market fit while maintaining cost efficiency.

The strategy incorporates brand positioning, commercial partnerships, and risk mitigation tactics, with a particular emphasis on seasonal route scheduling and diaspora outreach to build early traction. This work demonstrates a practical blend of strategic thinking, market analysis, and implementation planning aligned with the needs of a growing airline.
