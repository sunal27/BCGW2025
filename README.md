SkyLink Airlines: International Expansion Strategy - BCG Winter Case Competition 2025

This project presents a strategic international expansion plan for SkyLink Airlines, developed as part of the BCG Winter Case Competition 2025. The team assessed a range of international markets using structured entry criteria and identified Colombia as the strongest option for a pilot entry, based on tourism demand, operational feasibility and competitive dynamics.

The final proposal recommends launching flights from the US to Medellín and Cartagena, two high-potential cities that align with SkyLink’s low-cost model and avoid the slot constraints of Bogotá. The strategy outlines key elements including route selection, brand positioning, commercial partnerships and risk mitigation. A pilot approach has been recommended to minimise upfront exposure while enabling data-led decisions for future growth.

This work reflects a combination of strategic research, market prioritisation and clear operational planning tailored to the airline industry.
